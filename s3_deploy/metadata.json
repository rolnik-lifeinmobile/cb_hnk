Tested on Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, but it should work on any platform that supports symlinks.\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n    ['s3_deploy']['bucket'] = The name of the bucket containing the releases\n    ['s3_deploy']['deploy_root'] = The location where the app will be deployed on disk - defaults to \"/home/web\"\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nBest to explain by example:\n\nLet's assume we have an application called \"myapp\", and we want to deploy the build \"v1.2\" on our server.\nWe set the \"bucket\" attribute to \"app-releases\", and leave \"deploy_root\" as the default.\n\nFirst, we need to store the build in the \"app-releases\" S3 bucket. The build should be a single folder named after the release name (\"v1.2\" in our case), which is then compressed with Tar/Gz. So for our example, the package would be \"v1.2.tar.gz\" which contains the folder \"v1.2\".\n\nThis folder is then uploaded into S3, inside a folder named after the app: \"myapp/v1.2.tar.gz\"\n\nThen we'd put the following in our recipe\n\n\ts3_deploy \"myapp\" do\n\t\tbuild \"v1.2\"\n\t\tbucket \"mybucket\"\n\t\taction :create\n\tend\n\nand the resource will do the following:\n\n1. Create the folder \"/home/web/myapp\" if it's not already there\n2. Create the folder \"/home/web/myapp/releases\" if it's not already there\n3. Attempt to download the object \"mybucket/myapp/v1.2.tar.gz\" from the \"app-releases\" bucket, into \"/home/web/myapp/releases\"\n4. Unzip the package\n5. Symlink the package to \"/home/web/latest\"\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\nPlease refer to the Readme [here](https://github.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/cookbook-development/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Adam Borocz ([on GitHub](https://github.com/motns))\n\nCopyright:: 2013, HipSnip Ltd.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
