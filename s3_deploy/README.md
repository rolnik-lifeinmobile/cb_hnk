Description [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/s3_deploy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/s3_deploy)
===========
Somewhat similar to the Opscode deploy resource, but rather than hooking up to a source code repository, it downloads complete build packages from a specific Amazon S3 bucket.
The cookbook itself doesn't do much, besides providing an "s3_deploy" resource that takes care of the above.


Requirements
============
Needs the "s3cmd" cookbook to work. Tested on Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, but it should work on any platform that supports symlinks.


Attributes
==========

    ['s3_deploy']['bucket'] = The name of the bucket containing the releases
    ['s3_deploy']['deploy_root'] = The location where the app will be deployed on disk - defaults to "/home/web"


Usage
=====

Best to explain by example:

Let's assume we have an application called "myapp", and we want to deploy the build "v1.2" on our server.
We set the "bucket" attribute to "app-releases", and leave "deploy_root" as the default.

First, we need to store the build in the "app-releases" S3 bucket. The build should be a single folder named after the release name ("v1.2" in our case), which is then compressed with Tar/Gz. So for our example, the package would be "v1.2.tar.gz" which contains the folder "v1.2".

This folder is then uploaded into S3, inside a folder named after the app: "myapp/v1.2.tar.gz"

Then we'd put the following in our recipe

	s3_deploy "myapp" do
		build "v1.2"
		bucket "mybucket"
		action :create
	end

and the resource will do the following:

1. Create the folder "/home/web/myapp" if it's not already there
2. Create the folder "/home/web/myapp/releases" if it's not already there
3. Attempt to download the object "mybucket/myapp/v1.2.tar.gz" from the "app-releases" bucket, into "/home/web/myapp/releases"
4. Unzip the package
5. Symlink the package to "/home/web/latest"
